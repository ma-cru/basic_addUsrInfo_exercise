# basic_addUsrInfo_exercise
Basic add user exercise. Based on the requirements set out in Schwarzmüller's Complete Guide to React, but conceptualised and implemented alone.

This exercise sought to provide a way of validating, adding and displaying basic user info entries in React. Its implementation provides a simple RegEx pattern check on the name and lets the HTML enforce/validate the number entry for user age. 

If the entry is invalid, a modal will emerge that informs the user of the required format, reminds them of their entry and asks them to try again. If the entry is valid, it will be added to a list below the entry form.

And, that's it for this exercise.
